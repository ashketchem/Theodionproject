   This Indian chicken dish is popular throughout the world for the big flavor that comes from cooking chicken in a tandoor, the deep, urn-shaped clay oven. Legendary cookbook author Madhur Jaffrey adapted the recipe for a charcoal grill to make it accessible to home cooks.

<strong>Instructions</strong>
</h2>
        <ol>
           <li>step-1 <br>Make two diagonal incisions, each about 1 inch long, on center of each side of chicken pieces. (Slits, which should not start at an edge, should be deep enough to reach bone.)</li>
          <li> step-2 <br/>Place chicken pieces on a rimmed baking sheet. Squeeze 1 lemon over chicken, and sprinkle with salt. Gently rub 1 teaspoon salt and lemon juice into slits. Turn chicken over and repeat with remaining lemon and salt. Set aside for 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>step-3 <br />Blend yogurt, onion, garlic, ginger, green chile, and garam masala in a food processor or blender into a smooth paste, about 3 minutes. Transfer spice paste to a large bowl. Add chicken to bowl and turn until coated evenly in spice paste, being sure to get paste into slits. Cover chicken and refrigerate at least 5 hours, up to 24 hours.</li>
      <li>step-4 <br />Heat charcoal grill to high. Grill chicken over moderately high heat, basting with butter, until browned, 10 minutes. Turn and cook, basting with remaining butter, until lightly charred and cooked through, about 12 minutes. Squeeze lemon wedges over chicken and serve with naan.</li>
