            <li>1/2 cup bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup pizza sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pepperoni slices</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped onions</li>

           The crust is made from canned chicken. Canned chicken! It’s really brilliant if you think about It. Now, you can do one of two things: you can blend/pulse up the crust ingredients in a food processor. This method obviously grinds and blends everything up until smooth. If you are not a fan of texture, you will want to do this. If you’re like me, and want to taste the chicken and have texture, simply mash and mix everything together by hand; no food processor needed.
